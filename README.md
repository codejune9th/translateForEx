# translateForEx

TranslateForex is an iOS mobile App created for the personal goal of starting, maintaining, and updating a personal portfolio of stocks,
along with its conversion values in 10 foreign currencies and 10 cryptocurrencies ordered in volume of trades.

The stock prices are retrieved via Alpha Vantage API (https://www.alphavantage.co/documentation/) of any given date (starting from 2022).

The application is able to retrieve, record, save, and favorite stock prices at a given day's closing price within the mobile application.

This project was created in 2 days time as part of my HackReactor bootcamp's journey.
